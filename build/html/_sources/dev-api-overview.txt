API Overview
############
The following document will walk you through using the Cagenix API
within your application.

Base URL, HTTPS, and Versioning
===============================

Base URI
--------
The Cagenix API root is located at:
https://cagenix-web.herokuapp.com/api/v1/

HTTP and HTTPS
--------------
The Cagenix API is served over HTTP and HTTPS during testing. The final
deployment will be HTTPS only, prefer to testing that method.

Versioning
----------
Currently the Cagenix API does not require any type of versioning in the
requests as it is in the URI.

Message Body
------------
When submitting a request to the Cagenix API with a message body, the
variables within that body should be UTF8 encoded and within a JSON object.

Credentials
===========
In order to access the Cagenix API each developer/user must request a key and
a secret from the application admins. These two keys will be used in the
following formulas which will provide the properly formatted header values
required for all POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests. All GET requests require
the key, timestamp, and signature url parameters.

GET Requests
============
A properly formed GET request includes the key timestamp, and signature url
parameters. The key is the key provided by the application admins.  The
signature is made of the HTTP-VERB + SECRET + Canonicalized Resource encoded to
UTF8 hashed via sha256 and base 64 encoded.


+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| URL Param        | Description                                               |
+==================+===========================================================+
| key              | This is the key provided by the application admins.       |
+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| timestamp        | This is the date and time, ISO format, used in your       |
|                  | header formulas. An example is 2012-10-29T01:30:20Z.      |
|                  | Notice the T and Z, with the T separating the date and    |
|                  | time and Z ending the string.                             |
+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| signature        | The header signature is a string that combines the body   |
|                  | hash, date and time, along with your secret, encoded to   |
|                  | UTF8 and hashed using sha256.                             |
+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

.. note:: Signature = URLEncode(Base64( SHA-256( UTF-8-Encoding-Of( 'GET' + SECRET + URI ) ) ) ) )

Signature Example

::

    base64(sha256(utf8('GET'+'d59b8a775f0dcfd985edff5b5106e2a3'+'/api/v1/patients/1')))
    would result in
    PHNoYTI1NiBIQVNIIG9iamVjdCBAIDB4MTAzNDhhYTcwPg==

URL Example

::

    /api/v1/patients/1?signature=PHNoYTI1NiBIQVNIIG9iamVjdCBAIDB4MTAzNDhhYTcwPg==&timestamp=2014-01-26T00%3A26%3A49.000Z&key=d36a3127fc9f5fa169e911b9ab5b46eb

    This assumes:
        Key is d36a3127fc9f5fa169e911b9ab5b46eb
        Secret is d59b8a775f0dcfd985edff5b5106e2a3
        Time is 00:26:49 on 1/26/2014


Headers
=======
When interacting with the Cagenix web-service, the following headers are
required to be submitted with each request.

+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| body_hash        | This is the encoding of the body contents through the     |
|                  | following formula. If there are no body contents to be    |
|                  | sent, encode and send an empty body array.                |
+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| signature        | The header signature is a string that combines the body   |
|                  | hash, date and time, along with your secret, encoded to   |
